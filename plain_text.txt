Type 2 Diabetes
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels due to the body's ineffective use of insulin. Unlike Type 1 diabetes, where the body produces little to no insulin, Type 2 diabetes is mainly a result of insulin resistance, where the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin. Several risk factors contribute to the development of Type 2 diabetes, including genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Common risk factors include obesity, physical inactivity, poor diet, older age, family history of diabetes, and certain ethnic backgrounds (such as African-American, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian-American populations). Many individuals with Type 2 diabetes may not exhibit symptoms in the early stages. However, common symptoms include frequent urination, excessive thirst, increased hunger, fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, and recurrent infections. Diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes is typically made using blood tests such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG), the A1C test, or the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). An A1C level of 6.5% or higher, a fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL or higher, or a 2-hour plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher during an OGTT indicates diabetes. If not managed properly, Type 2 diabetes can lead to serious complications including heart disease, stroke, kidney damage (nephropathy), eye damage (retinopathy), nerve damage (neuropathy), foot problems, and increased risk of infections. Long-term complications can be disabling or life-threatening. Treatment focuses on maintaining blood glucose levels within a target range. Management typically involves a combination of lifestyle changes (healthy diet, regular physical activity, weight control), monitoring blood sugar levels, and medications. Common medications include metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin. In some cases, individuals may require multiple medications to control blood sugar effectively. Prevention of Type 2 diabetes is possible through lifestyle changes, especially in individuals at high risk. Weight loss, a healthy balanced diet, regular exercise, avoiding smoking, and moderate alcohol intake can significantly reduce the risk. Regular check-ups and early screening in at-risk individuals also play a key role in prevention. Managing diabetes is a lifelong commitment. With proper care, individuals can lead healthy, active lives. Patient education, support from healthcare professionals, and self-monitoring are essential for effective long-term management. Individuals are encouraged to work with a healthcare team to develop a personalized diabetes care plan.
